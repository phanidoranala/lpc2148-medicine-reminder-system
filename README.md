# LPC2148 Medicine Reminder System

Embedded C project using the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller to implement a user configurable medicine reminder system.
The system allows users to set medicine timings and provides alerts using LCD messages and buzzer notifications.

## Overview

This project implements a real-time medicine reminder system using the LPC2148 microcontroller.
The system continuously monitors time using the Real Time Clock (RTC) and compares it with the user-configured medicine schedule.

When the current time matches the stored medicine time, the system generates an alert using a buzzer or LED and displays a reminder message on the LCD display.

Users can configure the system through a 4x4 matrix keypad interface. The system also supports interrupt-based controls using external switches.

## Working Principle

The system works based on real-time comparison between RTC time and stored medicine schedules.

1. RTC continuously updates time
2. User sets medicine timings
3. System compares both values
4. If match occurs → Alert triggered
5. User acknowledges → System resets
